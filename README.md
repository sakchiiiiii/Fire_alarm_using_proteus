A fire alarm system has a number of devices working together to detect
and warn people through visual and audio appliances when smoke, fire,
carbon monoxide or other emergencies are present. These alarms may be
activated automatically from smoke detectors, and heat detectors or may
also be activated via manual fire alarm activation devices such as manual
call points or pull stations.
